# War_of_Ants
My_game
With ++, SDL2.
The game is a 2D strategy using the SDL2 graphics library.
Realized:
- Two colonies with 20 units.
- Purchase of new units with sufficient resources.
- Each unit is generated with its own special characteristics.
- Search for the nearest resource in relation to the unit (needs to be finalized)
- In the event that at the resource all the places occupied unit is looking for a new food.
- shipment of the resource to the colony.
- all units receive an invaluable experience for their work, and with a sufficient amount of experience they get a new level.

I plan to implement in the near future:
- control of the mouse.
- Implementation of interaction between units.
- expansion of the colony (expansion of the colony), increase of space for units and resources.
